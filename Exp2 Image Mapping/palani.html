  <p><strong>Arulmigu Dhandayuthapani Swami Temple</strong> is First of the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Abodes_of_Murugan">
      Six Abodes of Murugan(Aarupadai veedugal).</a> It is located in the city of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palani">Palani</a> earlier it was known as 'Thiruavinangudi',
    Dindigul district, 150 kilometres (93 mi) southeast of Coimbatore and northwest of Madurai in the
    foothills of the Palani Hills, Tamil Nadu,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">
      India.</a> Palani temple is considered synonymous with Panchamritam, a sweet mixture made of five
    ingredients.<br><br>

    As per Hindu legendary beliefs, Sage Narada visited the celestial court of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva"> Shiva</a> at
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kailash">Mount Kailash</a> to present to him a fruit,
    the gnana-palam (literally, the fruit of knowledge). He decided to award it to whichever of his two sons
    who first encircle the world thrice. Accepting the challenge, Murugan
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karthikeya">(Karthikeya)</a> started his journey around the globe
    on his mount peacock. However, Ganesha, who surmised that the world was no more than his parents Shiva
    and Shakti combined, circumambulated them and won the fruit. Murugan was furious and felt the need to
    get matured from boyhood and hence chose to remain as a hermit in Palani. The idol of the Muruga in
    Palani was created and consecrated by sage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogar">Bogar</a>, one of
    Hinduism's eighteen great siddhaars, out of an amalgam of nine poisonous herbs or Navapashanam.<br><br>

    Besides regular services, days sacred to the god Subrahmanyan are celebrated with pomp and splendour
    every year, and are attended by throngs of devotees from all over South India. Some of these festivals
    are the Thai-Poosam, the Pankuni-Uththiram, the Vaikhashi-Vishakham and the Soora-Samharam.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaipusam">Thai-Poosam</a>, which is considered, by far, the most
    important festival at Palani, is celebrated on the full moon day of the Tamil Month of Thai
    (15 January-15 February). Vaiyaapuri nattu Pattakkarar Muthukaali Tharagan gothram pangaalis of Sengunthar
    Kaikola Mudaliyar have rights to give festival flag for this temple. Because these people are Genealogy
    of Navaveerargal who helped lord Murugan in surasamharam battle. Pilgrims after first having taken a
    strict vow of abstinence, come barefoot, by walk, from distant towns and villages. Many pilgrims also
    bring a litter of wood, called a Kāvadi, borne on their shoulders, in commemoration of the act of the
    demon Hidumba who is credited by legend with bringing the two hills of Palani to their present location,
    slung upon his shoulders in a similar fashion. Others bring pots of sanctified water, known as
    theertha-kāvadi, for the priests to conduct the abhishekam on the holy day. Traditionally, the most
    honoured of the pilgrims, whose arrival is awaited with anticipation by all and sundry, are the people
    of Karaikudi, who bring with them the diamond-encrusted vél or javelin, of the Lord from His temple at
    Karaikudi.<br><br>
